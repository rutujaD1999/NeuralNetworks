# NeuralNetworks
Implementation of feedforward and backpropagation in neural networks in C++. Multiple activation functions such as tanh,relu,sigmoid and linear functions are used. The number of hidden layers and number of neurons in each layer are taken as input from the user along with the type of activation function to be used.
